The summary of the presentation is as follows
Note:
1.	This  is in the context of a housing finance industry
2.	Specifically this refers to the segment where the companies service lower end of the market viz. Low value housing for people who are in the lower income strata
3.	The context that is referred here is the need to reduce costs and hence offer lower interest rates to customers
4.	This is done by building processes that are on the internet, self-service so that we can reduce costs for many branches, personnel and processing applications.
5.	In effect we are reducing cost of acquisition of customer, reducing possibilities of bad loans, etc and thereby reducing interest rate offered to customers.
6. This was demonstrated with the shiny app and this ppt is a plug for that app.
